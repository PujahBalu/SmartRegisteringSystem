Smart Registering System

Abstract:

Up to ASTHRA – 2K18 symposium the registration process was done manually. This took a lot of man power, consumed a lot of time and loss of data also occurred. In order to eradicate such problems, we developed an application which would not consume much of the time and there will not be any data loss. Smart work is required to ourselves and we the students of Information Technology and this makes us stand unique from others. We developed two applications namely:
ASTHRA2K19 (QR Generator) ASTHRA19 (QR Scanner)

ASTHRA2K19 (QR Generator):

Using this application, we can generate a QR code for the participants individually which contain the information of the participant.


ASTHRA19 (QR Scanner):

Using this application, we can scan the participant’s QR code and the details present in the QR code is entered in the respective google sheet link mentioned in the application.

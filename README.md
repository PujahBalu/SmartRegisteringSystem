## ðŸ’» Development Process

1. Use MIT App Inventor to build:
   - QR Code Generator
   - QR Scanner with Google Sheets integration
2. Test real-time with live previews or using Android Emulator (Bluestacks)
3. Export APK and distribute per event

### ðŸ–¼ App Behavior
- Each event has its own scanner application with event-specific Google Sheet link.
- Scanned data is instantly reflected in corresponding sheets.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

Previously, registration was handled **manually**, causing:
- High manpower usage
- Time consumption
- Data loss risks

This QR-based system resolves all of the above with:
- **Quick registration**
- **Accurate data capture**
- **Minimal supervision**
